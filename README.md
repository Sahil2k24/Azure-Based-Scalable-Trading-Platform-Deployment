## üöÄ Key Features

### üì¶ Infrastructure Setup
- **Terraform** was used for automating the provisioning of Azure infrastructure, ensuring reproducibility and version control.
- The application was deployed on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** for efficient container orchestration, scaling based on load and demand.
- Kubernetes deployment strategies, such as rolling updates, were used to minimize downtime during application updates.

### üîí Security Enhancements
- **API Gateway**: Integrated API Gateway for secure API management, rate limiting, and monitoring API calls to protect the platform from malicious actors.
- **SonarQube Integration**: Integrated **SonarQube** scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous code quality checks. This ensures the codebase remains maintainable and secure with every deployment.

### üõ† CI/CD Automation
- Created robust **CI/CD pipelines** using **GitHub Actions** to automate deployments for the frontend, backend, and APIs.
- Automated infrastructure provisioning and application updates for consistent and repeatable deployment processes.
- Additionally, CI/CD for **APK deployment** was established to facilitate seamless deployment of Android app versions via the pipeline.

### üîç Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** were configured to provide **real-time monitoring** and visualizations of platform metrics, ensuring rapid response to issues.
- Integrated alerting mechanisms to trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage, memory, or disk space).
- DNS routing was optimized using **Azure Traffic Manager** to distribute traffic efficiently across various regions and ensure low-latency access to the platform.

### üì¢ Deployment & Cost Optimization
- Weekly deployment reports are generated to track successful deployments, application performance, and any potential failures.
- **Cost analysis** reports are generated monthly to ensure financial visibility and optimize the resources being utilized.
- **Cloud cost optimization** resulted in a **20% reduction** through proactive resource management, right-sizing of infrastructure, and choosing cost-effective Azure services.

## üîß Prerequisites

- **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have access to an Azure account and subscription.
- **Terraform**: Terraform CLI must be installed to provision the infrastructure.
- **Docker**: Docker is needed for building the container images.
- **Kubernetes**: Familiarity with Kubernetes and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration.
- **SonarQube**: For static code analysis and quality gates.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring and observability.
- **GitHub**: For the CI/CD pipeline automation with GitHub Actions.

## üìë Architecture

1. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: The application is deployed using Kubernetes, with AKS providing the underlying infrastructure.
2. **API Gateway**: Secures the platform APIs by managing and routing incoming API requests, ensuring proper security mechanisms such as rate limiting and traffic filtering.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates the entire deployment workflow, including building, testing, and deploying code for frontend, backend, APIs, and mobile apps.
4. **Monitoring**: Prometheus collects system and application metrics, while Grafana dashboards visualize the data, making it easy to monitor health and performance.
5. **Cost Optimization**: Azure's cost management tools analyze monthly usage and expenses to guide resource optimization efforts.

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Setup with Terraform

### Step 1: Provisioning Resources
Use Terraform to provision the necessary Azure resources. This includes:
- **AKS Cluster**: For containerized application deployment.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: For storing container images.
- **Virtual Network (VNet)**: For secure networking between services.
- **API Gateway**: For secure and centralized API management.

Terraform configuration files for infrastructure setup are located in the `terraform/` directory.

### Step 2: Running Terraform Scripts
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/azure-trading-platform.git
   cd azure-trading-platform/terraform
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Plan and apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. Once the infrastructure is provisioned, AKS will be available for deploying applications.

## üîß CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### Frontend & Backend CI/CD Pipelines
GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD pipeline automation. The workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/` for both the frontend and backend.

1. **Frontend Pipeline**: Builds, tests, and deploys the frontend code to AKS.
2. **Backend Pipeline**: Handles backend builds, tests, and deployment to AKS.

### APK Deployment Pipeline
The APK pipeline automates the deployment process for the Android application. This includes:
1. **Building the APK**: Using Android Build tools integrated with GitHub Actions.
2. **Uploading to Google Play Store**: Automating the upload process of APK to Google Play Store using **Fastlane**.

### Example Workflow for Frontend (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
name: Frontend CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to AKS
        run: kubectl apply -f kubernetes/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Prometheus Setup
Prometheus collects metrics from the AKS cluster, such as:
- CPU and memory usage
- Network I/O
- Disk I/O

### Grafana Setup
Grafana is used to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus. Key dashboards include:
- System health
- Resource usage
- Traffic routing performance

Alerts are configured for various thresholds, including:
- High CPU/Memory usage
- Deployment failure alerts
- Traffic anomalies

## üí° Cost Optimization Strategy

Azure cost management tools were used to track monthly resource usage and spending, with the following optimizations made:
- **Right-sizing resources**: Scaling down unused resources and adjusting instance sizes.
- **Auto-scaling**: Implemented auto-scaling rules for AKS based on workload demand.
- **Resource tags**: Tagging resources to better track and manage costs per department or project.

---

## üìù Weekly Deployment Reports

Weekly deployment reports are generated using GitHub Actions and sent to the team. These reports include:
- Summary of deployments.
- Failed deployments and reasons.
- Rollback actions (if any).

## üéØ Next Steps
- **Continuous improvement**: Further optimization of the CI/CD pipeline and monitoring tools.
- **Scalability**: Testing the scalability of the application by simulating increased traffic and load.
- **Security**: Conduct regular security audits and improve security practices.
